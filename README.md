# Robotic-System-Control-Processor-Simulation
This project is focused on designing and testing a processor for controlling a robotic system using Verilog. 
Key features:

System Verilog-based processor design for controlling a robotic system.
Testbench with different test cases to verify movement behavior.
VCD file generation for waveform analysis and visualization.
Supports both positive and negative coordinate movements, along with reset and oscillation tests.
Key Test Cases:
Idle state with no movement.
Movement to fixed target coordinates.
Oscillation between positive and negative coordinates.
Simulating resets during movement.
Extreme coordinate movements.
Random target movements and rapid back-and-forth transitions.
