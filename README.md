# Robotic-System-Control-Processor-Simulation
This project is focused on designing and testing a processor for controlling a robotic system using Verilog. 
Key features:

Verilog-based processor design for controlling a robotic system.
Testbench with different test cases to verify movement behavior.
VCD file generation for waveform analysis and visualization.
Supports both positive and negative coordinate movements, along with reset and oscillation tests.
